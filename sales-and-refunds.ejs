        <p>At blcnwht, we strive to ensure that you are completely satisfied with your purchase. This Sales and Refunds Policy outlines our terms regarding sales, returns, and refunds.</p>

        <h2>Sales Policy</h2>
        <p>All purchases made on our website are subject to availability. We reserve the right to limit the quantity of products we supply, and to refuse or cancel orders at our discretion. Prices for our products are subject to change without notice, but such changes will not affect orders that have already been placed.</p>

        <h2>Return Policy</h2>
        <p>If you are not fully satisfied with your purchase, you may return the item(s) within 30 days of the purchase date for a refund or exchange, provided the item is unworn, unwashed, and in its original packaging. To initiate a return, please contact our customer service team at <a href="mailto:returns@blcnwht.com">returns@blcnwht.com</a> and include your order number and reason for return.</p>

        <h2>Refunds</h2>
        <p>Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund. If approved, your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your original method of payment within a certain number of days, depending on your payment provider's policies.</p>
