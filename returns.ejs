        <p>At blcnwht, we strive to provide you with products that you love. If you are not completely satisfied with your purchase, our return and exchange policy makes it easy for you to get the right product.</p>

        <h2>Return Policy</h2>

To start a return, please visit our <a href="contact.ejs">Contact Us</a> page to reach our support team.</p>

        <h2>Exchange Policy</h2>
        <p>If you need a different size, color, or style, weâ€™re happy to offer exchanges on eligible items within 30 days of purchase. Just follow the same process as returns, and indicate that you would like an exchange.</p>

        <h2>Processing Time</h2>
        <p>Once we receive your return, it typically takes 5-7 business days to process. You will receive an email confirmation once your return has been processed. If you requested an exchange, the new item will be shipped to you as soon as the return is processed.</p>
